Circular Ref-error  use alias 
synthetic key-warning   use alias
default view-internal table view
load 2 scripts- default concatenate-1 table
default join-full outer join-1 table
keep better than join as no duplicates present
applymap better than keep
join with alias-cartesian product
aggregate functions-straight table not pivot table
trellis chart-not for pivot and straight table
binary statement-only 1 per code at top. used to use 1 file in another used in incremental load
let-calculates expression
set-assignes an expression
best data loading-coreect name convention, security script, hidden script, comments

Generate seq numbers-
Parallelism that allows data to operate in multiple components-data parallelism
rollup behaviour-input selection, temp init, rollup, finalisation, output selection
not a attribute of rollup-count
partition br rr-opposite of interleave
fuse-joins files with different formats
sort-does not support pipeline paralleslism
string concat-give parameter in double quotes

Raid0-mirroring
raid5,10-parity bits

vdisk failure-raid
node failure-clique
amp failure-fallback
derived and volatile table-spool space

EXPLAIN command
confidence-column been used frequently
low confidence-few statistics
With residual condition-where clause
PPI-partition primary index
join index

fastload
2 error loads-et, uv
et-constraint fail data
uv-duplicate data

Phases-aquisition, application


multiload
max 5 tables can be inserted
